# Making Changes to a Published Solution

If you want to make changes to your solution, e.g. name, description or image, you need to do the following:
1. Open the solution page and click the ***Edit*** button in the Settings menu:

    <img src="/assets/images/solutions/4.png" width="700"> 

    This will create a new draft of your solution and open the Solution Editor.

2. Make the updates to your solution, —Åheck with the ***Preview*** button, and once you good, click the ***Save*** button:

    <img src="/assets/images/solutions/5.png" width="700"> 

    This will save a draft of your solution, which you can submit for publication in the next step.
    **Note:** You can still make changes to the description, tags, etc., or change the app logo.

3. If you want to change the solution logo, open the Settings menu and select the ***Upload image*** section.

    <img src="/assets/images/solutions/6.png" width="700"> 

    This will allow you to upload a new image for your solution logo from your computer.

4. Once you've finished making changes to the app and/or uploading a new logo, you can submit your changes for approval with the ***Send for approval*** button.
